```{r include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
source(file="fisherXY.R")
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
require(knitr)
require(foreign)
GSS <-read.dta(file="GSS1998.dta")
GSS <- droplevels(GSS)
mydata <- select(GSS,race,age,eatout)
mydata <- na.omit(mydata)
```


```{r}
barchartGC(~race + eatout,data=mydata)
barchartGC(~race + eatout,data=mydata, type="percent")

```

There were about 1,150 white people surveyed with about 85% saying they do eat out and 15% saying they do not. There were about 300 black people surveyed with 70% saying they do eat out and 30% saying they do not. There were about 200 other people surveyed with about 70% saying they eat out and 30% saying they do not.


```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~race + eatout,data=mydata)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```

This table shows that about 83% of white people ate out, 69% of black people ate out, and 72% of other races ate out. The white people surveyed ate out more than the black people and the other races.
